It does it work but decays your enamle,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used it and got little results. Could be used for a month but don't use it regularly (my dentist also recommended the same) as it would decay your enamle. If your teeths are very yellow then go for some Desi jugads (home made remidies) or consult your dentist. It won't fully brighten your teeth but would give some result.
