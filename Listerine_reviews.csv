10,Effective Freshness  But a Strong Sensation,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Listerine Cool Mint Mouthwash definitely leaves your mouth feeling clean and refreshed. However, the intensity of the minty flavor can be a bit much for some people.Pros:Germ-fighting power:  There's no denying that Listerine does that powerful ""clean feeling"" that  indicates it's working hard at killing germs.Long-lasting freshness: The minty sensation will linger for a good amount of time after use.Value pack: Getting three bottles is a decent deal if you know you'll use them all.Cons:Overpowering mint: Some may find the initial coolness almost burning; it can be harsh on sensitive mouths.Leaves a dry feeling: It can leave your mouth feeling dry after extended use.Preference-based: If you don't enjoy very strong mint, this isn't the mouthwash for you.Overall: Listerine Cool Mint is effective at giving your mouth a deep clean and refreshing feeling.  However, if you have a sensitive mouth or aren't a fan of intense mint flavors, be aware that this might not be the best option.  Those who can tolerate the strong flavor will likely be happy with the cleaning power!",Reviewed in India on 12 February 2024,Verified Purchase

34,"If you can find a good substitute, avoid Listerine Mouthwash",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Someone mentioned that Listerine Mouthwash is a hedonic product, but I'm not sure as it isn't ""pleasant"". If you're using a good toothpaste, you really don't need to use this despite what all it claims as a good toothpaste would surely do all of that. Of course, unless you're just looking for something to spend on..... or some other exceptional reason. I won't be able to use toothpaste for an unspecified time and so I decided to brush (without toothpaste) and then use this. But this has a few problems. First of all, rinsing it after 30 seconds may cause some burning sensation. However, that's not too painful. In product description, it's mentioned that for best results, one shouldn't rinse mouth with water or eat and drink anything for 30 minutes post rinse. As it contains alcohol, it's not advisable to swallow it. I find that particularly inconvenient. Colgate Plax claims to have 0% alcohol and cause no burning sensation, so if that's true, I may go for it next time (although it's relatively expensive). Wish I'd done the research before! Hope that I can start using paste again soon. Have to use the 3 bottles though as it's not returnable. As a pack of 3 was cheaper than buying just one, I wisely bought what seemed to be cheaper! How was I supposed to know, right?!",Reviewed in India on 25 January 2023,Verified Purchase

40,Listerine: Pack of three doesn't seem original,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The media could not be loaded.I have been using Listerine mouth wash for quite some time and I know how it feels in my mouth (that's what she said). Listerine (not this product), whatever variant it maybe be, has a strong burning sensation. You can feel the alcohol at work if you use the original product. This pack of three mouthwash is so mellow you can clearly feel the difference. Tried scanning the QR code on the bottle, it's not even a QR code, just looks like one. I normally buy it from offline retail stores and the previous pack of three I bought from a Switch Kart (read between the lines), and it felt normal, how the original feels. I would just say Amazon should take a look into it and verify if original products are being sold to the customers.",Reviewed in India on 21 January 2024,Verified Purchase
